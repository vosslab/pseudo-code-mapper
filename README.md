# Concept Map Maker

Browser-only tool for students building concept maps: enter triples in a spreadsheet table, get an auto-laid-out SVG map with live rubric validation, drag-to-adjust layout, and one-click PNG/SVG/JSON/CSV export.

## Overview

Students in life-science courses build concept maps where bubbles hold a 1-3 word concept (noun)
and directed arrows carry verb phrases ("concept maps --organize--> ideas"). This app runs entirely
in the browser with no install, no account, and no backend. Students enter rows in a
spreadsheet-like triples table (This concept | verb phrase | points to this concept); the app
auto-generates an SVG map using dagre auto-layout, colors bubbles by graph distance from origin
bubbles, validates the assignment rubric live (30+ unique concepts, a verb phrase on every arrow),
and saves work automatically in localStorage. Exports include PNG, SVG, JSON, CSV, and print.

The UI includes a two-state light/dark theme toggle; the on-screen concept map adapts to the
selected theme while SVG/PNG exports remain light. The app is deployed on GitHub Pages and runs
with no server.
